We say that this hexagon is located at row zero and column zero. Next put the number 1 in each of the two hexagons in row 1. Now put a 1 in row two column zero, a 2 in row two column one, and another 1 in row two column two. Put the numbers 1,3,3,1 in row three. Fill in the rest of the hexagons.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nRender PDF requires pylatex installation.\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n![Pascal's Triangle](image/pascals-triangle-16){width=\"90%\"}\n\n",
