In this problem, you will find the first few\nprime numbers using the Sieve of Eratosthenes. Find out how many prime numbers\nare less than 120.\n\nWrite out then numbers 1-120 in order in the grid below. Cross out two. Circle \ntwo, this is the first prime. Now cross out (or color out) all multiples of two \nexcept two itself. The next number not crossed out is three. Circle it since it\nis the next prime. Now cross out all multiples of three except three itself. \nRepeat this process: find the then next number which is not crossed out; this \nis the next prime; circle it and then cross out all multiples of it except \nitself. Keep going until you can't cross out any more. Count the primes (circled\nnumbers).\n\n\n\n![Sieve of Eratosthenes](image/sieve){width=50%}\n\n",
