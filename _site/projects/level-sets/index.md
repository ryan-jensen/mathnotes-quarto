The following images are generated by a haskell library I am writing for
applied topology. The first step is to generate the level sets using the
[marching cubes
algorithm,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marching_cubes) which I\'ve
implemented in haskell. Then next part is to compute the persistent
homology via left or sub level set filtration; this also includes ideas
from large scale geometry.

# Barnes et al.

Julie Barnes, William Kreahling, and Beth Schaubroeck published a
[Coloring Book of Complex Function
Representations](https://www.amazon.com/Coloring-Book-Complex-Function-Representations/dp/0883855917).
This coloring book has several pretty images generated via level sets of
complex valued functions. Since the book is available for purchase, I
thought the images in the book needed
[barcodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_homology); hence my
interest in the project.

![Plate 3 from the book by Barnes et al. Let $f(z) = z^2 - 0.003/z^2$
and $g(z) = \Re(f^5(z))$. The image is
$g^{-1}(0) \cap [-1,1]\times [-1,1]$.](./Plate-03.png "plate-03")

And here is a [pdf](Plate-03-with-barcode.pdf) of the image with its
barcode generated by left level set filtration.

# Batman Logo

This image looks strikingly similar to the Batman Logo.

![Let $f(z) = z^2 - 1.75488$ and $g(z) = \Re(f^6(z))$. The image is
$g^{-1}(\{\pm 0,1,2,4,8,16\}) \cap [-2,2]\times [-1/2,1/2]$.](./Bat-Logo.png "bat-logo")

And here is a [pdf](Bat-Logo-with-barcode.pdf) of the image with its
barcode generated by left level set filtration.
