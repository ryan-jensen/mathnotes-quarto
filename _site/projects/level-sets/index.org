#+title: Homology of Level Sets

#+author: Ryan Jensen
The following images are generated by a haskell library I am writing for
applied topology. The first step is to generate the level sets using the
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marching_cubes][marching cubes
algorithm,]] which I've implemented in haskell. Then next part is to
compute the persistent homology via left or sub level set filtration;
this also includes ideas from large scale geometry.

Julie Barnes, William Kreahling, and Beth Schaubroeck published a
[[https://www.amazon.com/Coloring-Book-Complex-Function-Representations/dp/0883855917][Coloring
Book of Complex Function Representations]]. This coloring book has
several pretty images generated via level sets of complex valued
functions. Since the book is available for purchase, I thought the
images in the book needed
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_homology][barcodes]]; hence
my interest in the project.

And here is a [[file:Plate-03-with-barcode.pdf][pdf]] of the image with
its barcode generated by left level set filtration.

This image looks strikingly similar to the Batman Logo.

And here is a [[file:Bat-Logo-with-barcode.pdf][pdf]] of the image with
its barcode generated by left level set filtration.
