The first step is to generate the level sets using the marching cubes algorithm, which I've implemented in haskell. Then next part is to compute the persistent homology via left or sub level set filtration; this also includes ideas from large scale geometry.\n\nBarnes et al.\nJulie Barnes, William Kreahling, and Beth Schaubroeck published a Coloring Book of Complex Function Representations. This coloring book has several pretty images generated via level sets of complex valued functions. Since the book is available for purchase, I thought the images in the book needed barcodes; hence my interest in the project.\n\n\n\nPlate 3 from the book by Barnes et al. Let \\(f(z) = z^2 - 0.003/z^2\\) and \\(g(z) = \\Re(f^5(z))\\). The image is \\(g^{-1}(0) \\cap [-1,1]\\times [-1,1]\\).\n\n\nAnd here is a pdf of the image with its barcode generated by left level set filtration.\n\n\nBatman Logo\nThis image looks strikingly similar to the Batman Logo.\n\n\n\nLet \\(f(z) = z^2 - 1.75488\\) and \\(g(z) = \\Re(f^6(z))\\).

The results from computing the homology are much better when this is done. At this point the trimming has been done manually based on each image, but it would be nice to have an automated way to do it.\nimage2D(testR$rawSlicesTrimmed,asp = 1, axes=FALSE, colkey = FALSE, xlab=\"\", ylab=\"\")\n\n\nThresholded Image Slices\nNext we show the results after an automatic thresholding function has been applied to each slice individually. This function comes from an R-package.\nimage2D(testR$thSlices,asp = 1, axes=FALSE, colkey = FALSE, xlab=\"\", ylab=\"\")\n\n\n3D Point Cloud\nBelow is an interact 3D point cloud of a random sample taken from the full point cloud generated from the stacked image. The sample is random, but points with higher intensity have a higher probability of being chosen. Hence if there is a high intensity region in the cell, there is a high probability that the sample will include points from this area.\ntestR$cloudPlot\nfile:test-3d-point-cloud.html\n\n\nThe Persistence Diagram\nHere is the persistence diagram for the test image. The black dots are the connected components, the red are the 1-holes, and the blue are the 2-holes. For a cell with high intensity around the boundary, one would expect a blue point far away from the diagonal. For a cell with intensity dispersed throughout, one would expect any blue points to be near the diagonal.\npar(mfrow=c(1,1))\nplot(testR$ripsDiag[[\"diagram\"]])"

The blue dot far from the diagonal in the persistence diagrams indicates that the protein is distributed along the cell boundary, meaning little protein made it into the cell."
