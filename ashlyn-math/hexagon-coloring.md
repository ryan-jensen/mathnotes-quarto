#### Problem
If you haven't already done so, do [Pascal's Triangle](pascals-triangle.qmd) 
and [Pascal's Trinagle Coloring](pascals-triangle-coloring.qmd) problems first.

This hexagon is made by taking six copies of Pascal's Triangle, and then 
connecting them along the diagonals containing ones. As you did in 
[Pascal's Trinagle Coloring](pascals-triangle-coloring.qmd), color all the 
small hexagons containing an odd number one color, and all the small hexagons 
containing an even number another color.
