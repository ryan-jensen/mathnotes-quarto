#### Problem

Put a number 1 in the top most hexagon. We say that this hexagon is located at row zero and column zero. Next put the number 1 in each of the two hexagons in row 1. Now put a 1 in row two column zero, a 2 in row two column one, and another 1 in row two column two. Put the numbers 1,3,3,1 in row three. Fill in the rest of the hexagons.
