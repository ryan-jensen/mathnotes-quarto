#### Problem
There are nine pills which are identical except one pill has a different 
weight than the other eight. The eight identical pills are all poison and will 
kill you. Then nineth pill weighs different than the eight and will not hurt
you. You have a balance scale which you may use no more than three times. You
must take a pill. Figure out which pill is safe to take.
