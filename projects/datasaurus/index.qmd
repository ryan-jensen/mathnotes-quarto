## Datasaurus
The datasaurus is a collection of 13 sets of data points. Each set has 
5 (almost) identical statistcs. Scatter plots reveal that while basic
statics are the same, their look arrangement is very different. 

I've modified the original datasaurs collection slightly, and applied
persistent homology in order to differentiate some of the data sets.
My results are below.
